# Mine-verse
Like the metaverse, but in minecraft.

# Features I'm wanting to add
1) The ability to send items to the chain on a mc server then pull them down on a different server to create a kind of planet feel where they can travel to different "countries" (servers) and buy/sell and use their items accross all servers connected to the chain

2) The ability to buy chunks and have ownership on the chain.

3) The ability to have a type of stock market.
